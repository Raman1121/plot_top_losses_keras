Data is the better half of machine learning models. This is why it is important to make sure that our models are exposed to quality data while they are training. Real data is noisy, unclean, and often confusing. In our lives also, lessons that are too confusing to grasp make it extremely difficult for us to actually learn a respective topic. The same drill applies to machine learning models too.

This repository contains code for a simple utility in TensorFlow and Keras that plots images from a training set that cause a model to incur high losses during its training.

The code is accompanied by [this report](to be added later when the final report is ready from our end) that contains additional details. 

## Misc details
- Dataset used: MNIST
- Model used: A simple CNN like [this one](https://app.wandb.ai/tulasi1729/plot-top-losses/runs/mnist-demo-kerascallback/model?workspace=user-sayakpaul)
